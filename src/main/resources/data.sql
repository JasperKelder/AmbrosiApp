Make sure you also make the border about 2 inches high. Press down well with a spoon and put in it in the fridge. Now melt the rest of the butter in a pot. Then add the condensed milk and caster sugar and keep stirring. It takes about 10 minutes for the caramel to have the right consistency. After 5 minutes, add 2 teaspoons of sea salt and keep stirring. Remove the tin from the refrigerator and divide the caramel over it. Put the tin back in the refrigerator and let it cool for an hour. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate together with 100 milliliters of milk au-bain marie (in a bowl over a pan of boiling water). Pour the chocolate over the caramel layer once it has cooled down properly. Put the cake in the fridge for another 30 minutes, so that the chocolate hardens. Melt 100 grams of fudge with the rest of the milk in a pot until caramel.
