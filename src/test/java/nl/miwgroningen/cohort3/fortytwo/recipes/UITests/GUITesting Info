This file contains information about testing with cucumber and selenium.

The features package contains the feature files where scenarios will be created.
The Steps package implement those features
The features package also contains a chromedrive.exe which will be called when testing the UI

The steps found in the feature file must be equal to the annotations above the methods in the Steps package.

In which order the tests will compile are dependent on the order of the features package, so i gave them a number
to order them

The RunCucumberTest class will setup the driver and the test environment.
